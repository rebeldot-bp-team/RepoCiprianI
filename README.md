# Ciprian's implementation of asssignment

- [x] Use a real API to search for movies as we type â€“ via omdb api 
- [x] Create a "Netflix style" horizontal scroll effect (created using `<FlatList>` with `horizontal` prop as true)
- [x] Add movies to and remove them from our favourites
- [x] Save user favourites to local storage for the data to appear when the app refreshes. (used `redux-toolkit` and `redux-persist`)

## How it works?

## Implementation detetails

- React Navigation to mimic some screens that can solve this problem. (Home, Seach, Details)
- Typescript to enforce type safety
- Redux and Redux Persist for better state management and data persistance
